## Troubleshooting

### Voice Note Not Sending
If voice notes are not being sent to the chatbot:

1. **Check Speech Recognition Status**
   - Look for the status indicator: "üé§ Voice recognition ready" or "‚ùå Voice recognition not available"
   - If showing red, speech recognition is not available

2. **Browser Permissions**
   - Ensure microphone access is granted to the website
   - Check browser settings for microphone permissions

3. **Test Voice Functionality**
   - Use the "Test Voice" button in the quick actions
   - Speak clearly and wait for the text to appear
   - Tap the stop button to send the message

4. **Debug Information**
   - Open browser developer console (F12)
   - Look for speech recognition logs
   - Check for any error messages

### Common Issues

1. **"No speech detected"**
   - Speak more clearly and slowly
   - Ensure microphone is working
   - Try in a quieter environment

2. **"Voice recognition not available"**
   - Check browser compatibility
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for microphone access)
   - Try a different browser

3. **Recording starts but doesn't stop**
   - Tap the stop button (red button with stop icon)
   - Wait for the recording to process
   - Check if text appears in the input field

### Testing Steps

1. **Basic Test**
   - Tap the microphone button
   - Say "eye pain" or "ÿ£ŸÑŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿπŸäŸÜ"
   - Tap the stop button
   - Verify text appears and message is sent

2. **Advanced Test**
   - Use the "Test Voice" button
   - Speak a longer sentence
   - Check if partial results appear
   - Verify final result is sent

3. **Error Test**
   - Try speaking very quietly
   - Check if error message appears
   - Verify fallback behavior works
